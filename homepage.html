    <h2 class="segment_header">About Us</h2>
    <div class="textbox">
        <p>Have you ever wanted to play your favorite game but couldn’t find 
            the right person to play with? Struggling through random game lobbies 
            with random people can feel like such a hassle when you just want to have 
            a good time with the right people. This is where our project known as G-inder 
            (Gamer Tinder) will help. G-inder is an online gamer database where different 
            players from different games can put up posts looking for other people to play 
            with. In each of these posts players will discuss what kind of players they’re 
            looking for whether it be purely to have fun with others, or it be skilled based 
        if someone is looking for a person of similar ranks in their game.</p>

        <p>You may use our website anonymously or create a profile by clicking on the navigation
            bar above. You may then go to the Find Gamers tab and look through the posts either 
            by scrolling or using the search bar on the page. Once someone finds a post in our database 
            that matches what they're looking for they can click on the user's post and comment to let 
            the poster know that they're available. From here the poster can click on the commenters 
            profile and decide if he or she wants to join up with this player and add him on their preferred 
            gaming device. Profiles can include details such as preferred gaming device, preferred games, 
            and skill level within the game.

    <div class="textbox">
        <p>
            <li>Do not organize, participate in, or encourage harassment of others. Disagreements happen and are normal, but continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments may cross the line into harassment and are not okay. </li>
            <li>Do not organize, promote, or coordinate posts around hate speech. It’s unacceptable to attack a person or a community based on attributes such as their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or disabilities.</li>
            <li>Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others. This includes indirect threats, as well as sharing or threatening to share someone’s private personal information (also known as doxxing).</li>
